# Machine Learning internship
This repository contains the Python scripts developed during my internship. <br/>
I have included them to demonstrate how to apply machine learning algorithms to real datasets, from cleaning and clustering to prediction using classical artificial neural networks. <br/>
Additionally, I compared these predictions with Gaussian process regression, which provides more insight into confidence intervals and can be useful as a measure of experimental/numerical uncertainties.
