# Machine_Learning_internship
This repository contains the python scripts developed during my intership.<br />
I have added them to show how to apply ML algorithm to real dataset from cleaning and clustering to prediction using clasical artificial neural networks, an comparing its prediction with Gaussian process regresion which provide more insight about confidence intervals, which might be useful as a measure of experimental/numerical uncertainty.
